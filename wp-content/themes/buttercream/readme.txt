Buttercream is a cute microblogging theme.

Buttercream supports all WordPress post formats and includes three different theme styles--Confetti (default), Chocolate Orange and Red Velvet. It also supports a responsive layout for small screens, custom flyout menus, custom headers, three widget areas in the footer, and custom backgrounds.

As Buttercream is designed to be a microblog-style theme, page navigation does not show by default. However, if you'd like page navigation, simply create a custom menu under Appearance -> Menus and assign it to the Navigation area. This will create a navigation bar at the bottom of the site.

Google Web fonts used are Norican, Alegreya and Stint Ultra Condensed.

Cupcake illustrations included with this theme were created by me and licensed under the GPL.
